### Lag Guidelines
1. Create
  1. Avoid funnels if possible. They are generally bad due to implementation.
  2. Pipes can be laggy if they have more than 1 input and output and 1 pump.
  3. Do not build huge vanilla (dripstone + cauldron) lava farms, use a hose pulley to pump from an infinite pool. 
2. Loose items
  1. Drills leave behind dropped items. 
     a) Use cobblestone generators and/or drills on contraption with storage.
     b) Use AE2 annihilation planes
  2. Do not design farms throwing items around or dropping items. 
     a) Do not drop items into lava using funnels, use chutes instead.
  3. Make sure that your contraption has enough storage.
3. Entities
  1. Keep contraptions small.
     a) Any running contraption using block modifying machines (i.e drills, deployers, saws, etc.) should not exceed a maximum of 10x10.
     b) You must not run more than 1 contraption at the same time.
     c) Having more than 1 contraption is only allowed when:
         1) The contraptions serve different purposes or uses.
  2. Avoid excess mobs in a single location. 
     a) If your mobs are cramping or constantly bumping into each other, you have too many mobs.
4. Chunk loading
  1. Chunk loading is not allowed.
     a) Chunk loaders are disabled (if there are any)
     b) Forceloaded chunks are an exception. They are only available for donators.
5. Other
  1. Do not carry contraptions, AE2 cells or other items with large amounts of NBT data in your inventory, backpack, shulker, etc.
     a) It lags the server.
     b) It can "book-ban" you.
  2. Using Ledger
     a) Ledger is to be used only for checking if you have been robbed or griefed.
         1) Do not smap Ledger. Doing this will result in a temporary ban and a warn!

**Intentionally breaking these guidelines will result in stopping or potentially removing your farms/contraptions, and if repeated, it might result in a temporary ban.**
**These guidelines are in place to make the experience better for everyone.**
